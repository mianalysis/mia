    <p class="text-center mia-main-text">Relate objects of two classes based on a variety of metrics (e.g. spatial overlap or proximity).  The assigned relationships are of the form many-to-one, where many input "child" objects can be related to at most, one "parent" object.  Measurements associated with this relationship (e.g. distance from child to parent surface) are stored as measurements of the relevant child object.</p>

Since object ID numbers are unique within an object collection there will always be no more than one parent to a child.</li><li>"Proximity" Children are related to the spatially-closest object from the parent collection.  The exact distances used (e.g. centroid to centroid or surface to surface) are controlled by the "Reference point" parameter.</li><li>"Spatial overlap" Children are related to the object from the parent collection they have the greatest spatial overlap with.

These distances are always positive; increasing as the distance between centroids increases.</li><li>"Child centroid to parent surface" Distances are from child object centroids to the closest point on parent object surfaces.  These distances increase in magnitude the further from the parent surface a child centroid is; however, they are assigned a positive value if the child is outside the parent and a negative value if the child is inside the parent.  For example, a centroid 5px outside the object will be simply "5px", whereas a centroid 5px from the surface, but contained within the parent object will be recorded as "-5px".</li><li>"Surface" Distances are between the closest points on the child and parent surfaces.  These distances increase in magnitude the greater the minimum parent-child surface distance is; however, they are assigned a positive value if the closest child surface point is outside the parent and a negative value if the closest child surface point is inside the parent.  For example, a closest child surface point 5px outside the object will be simply "5px", whereas a closest child surface point 5px from the surface, but contained within the parent object will be recorded as "-5px".
