<h1>Number of partners</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Filter an object collection based on the number of partners each object has from another object collection.  The threshold (reference) value can be either a fixed value (same for all objects), a measurement associated with an image (same for all objects within a single analysis run) or a measurement associated with a parent object (potentially different for all objects).  Objects which satisfy the specified numeric filter (less than, equal to, greater than, etc.) can be removed from the input collection, moved to another collection (and removed from the input collection) or simply counted (but retained in the input collection).  The number of objects failing the filter can be stored as a metadata value.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li>Input objects<ul><li>Description: Objects to be filtered.</li><li>Type: InputObjectsP</li></ul><br><li>Filter mode<ul><li>Description: Controls what happens to objects which don't pass the filter:<br><ul><li>"Do nothing" Retains all input objects, irrespective of whether they passed or failed the filter.  This is useful when also storing the filter results as metadata values (i.e. just counting the number of objects which pass the filter).</li><li>"Move filtered objects to new class" Objects failing the filter are moved to a new object class.  The name of the class is determined by the "Output (filtered) objects" parameter.  All existing measurements and relationships are carried forward into the new object collection.</li><li>"Remove filtered objects" (default) Removes objects failing the filter.  Once removed, these objects are unavailable for further use by modules and won't be included in exported results.</li></ul></li><li>Type: ChoiceP</li><li>Default value: Remove filtered objects</li><li>Choices: <ul><li>Do nothing</li><li>Move filtered objects to new class</li><li>Remove filtered objects</li></ul></li></ul><br><li>Output (filtered) objects<ul><li>Description: New object collection containing input objects which did not pass the filter.  These objects are only stored if "Filter mode" is set to "Move filtered objects to new class".</li><li>Type: OutputObjectsP</li></ul><br><li>Method for filtering<ul><li>Description: Numeric comparison used to determine which objects should be removed.  Objects with specified property (e.g. a measurement value) that passes this filter will be removed.  For example, an object with a measurement value of 7 would be removed if "Method for filtering" is set to "Less than" with a reference value of 10.  Options are: Less than, Less than or equal to, Equal to, Greater than or equal to, Greater than, Not equal to.</li><li>Type: ChoiceP</li><li>Default value: Equal to</li><li>Choices: <ul><li>Less than</li><li>Less than or equal to</li><li>Equal to</li><li>Greater than or equal to</li><li>Greater than</li><li>Not equal to</li></ul></li></ul><br><li>Reference mode<ul><li>Description: Type of reference value used to compare objects to:<br><ul><li>"Fixed value" Objects will be compared to a single, fixed value specified using the "Reference value" parameter.</li><li>"Image measurement" Objects will be compared to a measurement associated with an image in the workspace.  The image and associated measurement are specified by the "Reference value image" and "Reference image measurement" parameters.  In this mode, all objects will still be compared to the same value; however, this value can vary between input files.</li><li>"Parent object measurement" Objects will be compared to a measurement associated with a parent object.  The parent object and measurement are specified by the "Reference value parent object" and "Reference object measurement" parameters.  In this mode all objects can (but won't necessarily) be compared to different values.</li></ul></li><li>Type: ChoiceP</li><li>Default value: Fixed value</li><li>Choices: <ul><li>Fixed value</li><li>Image measurement</li><li>Parent object measurement</li></ul></li></ul><br><li>Reference value<ul><li>Description: When "Reference mode" is set to "Fixed value", all objects will be compared to this fixed value.</li><li>Type: DoubleP</li><li>Default value: 1.0</li></ul><br><li>Reference value image<ul><li>Description: When "Reference mode" is set to "Image measurement", all objects will be compared to a measurement associated with this image.</li><li>Type: InputImageP</li></ul><br><li>Reference image measurement<ul><li>Description: When "Reference mode" is set to "Image measurement", all objects will be compared to this measurement, which itself is associated with the image specified by "Reference value image".</li><li>Type: ImageMeasurementP</li></ul><br><li>Reference value parent object<ul><li>Description: When "Reference mode" is set to "Parent object measurement", all objects will be compared to a measurement associated with their parent object from this collection.</li><li>Type: ParentObjectsP</li></ul><br><li>Reference object measurement<ul><li>Description: When "Reference mode" is set to "Parent object measurement", all objects will be compared to this measurement, which itself is associated with the parent object specified by "Reference value parent object".</li><li>Type: ObjectMeasurementP</li></ul><br><li>Reference value multiplier<ul><li>Description: Irrespective of how the reference value was determined, it can be systematically adjusted prior to use for comparison using this multiplier.  For example, an image measurement reference value of 32 with a "Reference value multiplier" of "0.5" will see all objects compared against a value of 16.  This is useful when comparing to dynamic values coming from image and parent object measurements.</li><li>Type: DoubleP</li><li>Default value: 1.0</li></ul><br><li>Store summary filter results<ul><li>Description: When selected, a metadata value is stored in the workspace, which records the number of objects which failed the filter and were removed or moved to another object class (depending on the "Filter mode" parameter).</li><li>Type: BooleanP</li><li>Default value: false</li></ul><br><li>Store individual filter results<ul><li>Description: When selected, each input object will be assigned a measurement reporting if that object passed or failed the filter.  The measurement value is "1" for objects that failed the filter (i.e. would be removed if the relevant removal setting was enabled) and "0" for objects that passed (i.e. wouldn't be removed).</li><li>Type: BooleanP</li><li>Default value: false</li></ul><br><li>Partner objects<ul><li>Description: Objects will be filtered against the number of partners they have from this object collection.</li><li>Type: PartnerObjectsP</li></ul><br></ul>
