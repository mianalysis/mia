    <p class="text-center mia-main-text">Filter an object collection based on a measurement value associated with this object.  The threshold (reference) value can be either a fixed value (same for all objects), a measurement associated with an image (same for all objects within a single analysis run) or a measurement associated with a parent object (potentially different for all objects).  Objects which satisfy the specified numeric filter (less than, equal to, greater than, etc.) can be removed from the input collection, moved to another collection (and removed from the input collection) or simply counted (but retained in the input collection).  The number of objects failing the filter can be stored as a metadata value.</p>
