<h1>Relate one-to-one</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Relate objects of two classes based on spatial proximity or overlap.  With this module, each object from a collection can only be linked to one other object (see "Relate many-to-many" and "Relate many-to-one" modules for alternatives).  The assignments are chosen to give the optimal overall relationship connectivity.  As such, an object may not be linked to its own best match if that best match is itself closer still to another object.  Related objects are assigned partner relationships and can optionally also be related by a common cluster (parent) object.  Measurements associated with this relationship (e.g. distance to the related object) are stored as measurements of the relevant object.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input objects 1</b> (default = "") First objection collection from the workspace to relate objects for.  These objects will be related to the objects from the collection specified by "Input objects 2".  Related objects will be given partner relationships and optionally (depending on the state of "Create cluster objects") be related by a common parent cluster object.</li><br><li><b>Input objects 2</b> (default = "") Second objection collection from the workspace to relate objects for.  These objects will be related to the objects from the collection specified by "Input objects 1".  Related objects will be given partner relationships and optionally (depending on the state of "Create cluster objects") be related by a common parent cluster object.</li><br><li><b>Create cluster objects</b> (default = "true") When selected, new "cluster" objects will be created and added to the workspace.  These objects contain no spatial information, but act as links between all objects that were related.  Both objects identified as relating to each other are stored as children of the same cluster object.</li><br><li><b>Output cluster objects</b> (default = "") If storing cluster objects (when "Create cluster objects" is selected), the output cluster objects will be added to the workspace with this name.</li><br><li><b>Relationship mode</b> (default = "Spatial overlap") Controls the type of calculation used when determining which objects are related:<br><ul><li>"Centroid separation" Distances are calculated from object centroid to object centroid.  These distances are always positive; increasing as the distance between centroids increases.</li><li>"Spatial overlap" The percentage of each object, which overlaps with another object is calculated.</li></li><br><li><b>Maximum separation</b> (default = "1.0") If "Relationship mode" is set to "Centroid separation", this is the maximum separation two objects can have and still be related.</li><br><li><b>Calibrated units</b> (default = "false") When selected, spatial values are assumed to be specified in calibrated units (as defined by the "Input control" parameter "Spatial units").  Otherwise, pixel units are assumed.</li><br><li><b>Minimum overlap of object 1 (%)</b> (default = "50.0") If "Relationship mode" is set to "Spatial overlap", this is the minimum percentage overlap the first object must have with the other object for the two objects to be related.</li><br><li><b>Minimum overlap of object 2 (%)</b> (default = "50.0") If "Relationship mode" is set to "Spatial overlap", this is the minimum percentage overlap the second object must have with the other object for the two objects to be related.</li><br></ul>
