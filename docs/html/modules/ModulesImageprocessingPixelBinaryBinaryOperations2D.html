<h1>Binary operations 2D</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Applies stock ImageJ binary operations to an image in the workspace.  This image must be 8-bit and have the logic black foreground (intensity 0) and white background (intensity 255).  All operations are performed in 2D, with higher dimensionality stacks being processed slice-by-slice.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input image</b> (default = "") Image from workspace to apply binary operation to.  This must be an 8-bit binary image (255 = background, 0 = foreground).</li><br><li><b>Apply to input image</b> (default = "true") When selected, the post-operation image will overwrite the input image in the workspace.  Otherwise, the image will be saved to the workspace with the name specified by the "Output image" parameter.</li><br><li><b>Output image</b> (default = "") If "Apply to input image" is not selected, the post-operation image will be saved to the workspace with this name.</li><br><li><b>Filter mode</b> (default = "Dilate") Controls which binary operation will be applied.  All operations assume the default ImageJ logic of black objects on a white background.  The operations are described in full at [WEBSITE]:<br><ul><li>"Dilate" Change any foreground-connected background pixels to foreground.  This effectively expands objects by one pixel.</li><li>"Distance map" Create a 32-bit greyscale image where the value of each foreground pixel is equal to its Euclidean distance to the nearest background pixel.</li><li>"Erode" Change any background-connected foreground pixels to background.  This effectively shrinks objects by one pixel.</li><li>"Fill holes" Change all background pixels in a region which is fully enclosed by foreground pixels to foreground.</li><li>"Outline" Convert all non-background-connected foreground pixels to background.  This effectively creates a fully-background image, except for the outer band of foreground pixels.</li><li>"Skeletonise" Repeatedly applies the erode process until each foreground region is a single pixel wide.</li><li>"Ultimate points" Repeatedly applies the erode process until each foreground is reduced to a single pixel.  The value of the remaining, isolated foreground pixels are equal to their equivalent, pre-erosion distance map values.  This process outputs a 32-bit greyscale image.</li><li>"Voronoi" Creates an image subdivided by lines such that all pixels contained within an enclosed region are closest to the same contiguous object in the input binary image.</li><li>"Watershed" Peforms a distance-based watershed transform on the image.  This process is able to split separate regions of a single connected foreground region as long as the sub-regions are connected by narrow necks (e.g. snowman shape).  Background lines are drawn between each sub-region such that they are no longer connected.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Number of iterations</b> (default = "1") Number of times the operation will be run on a single image.  For example, this allows objects to be eroded further than one pixel in a single step.</li><br><li><b>Count</b> (default = "1") The minimum number of connected background or foreground for an erosion or dilation process to occur, respectively.</li><br></ul>
