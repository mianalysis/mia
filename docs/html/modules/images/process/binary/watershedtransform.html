    <p class="text-center mia-main-text">Peforms a watershed transform on a specified input image.  This process is able to split separate regions of a single connected foreground region as long as the sub-regions are connected by narrow necks (e.g. snowman shape).  Background lines are drawn between each sub-region such that they are no longer connected.  This can use specific markers and be run in either distance or intensity-based modes.  Uses the plugin "<a href="https://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ">MorphoLibJ</a>".</p>

This image must be of equal dimensions to the input image (to which the transform will be applied).  This image will be 8-bit with binary logic determined by the "Binary logic" parameter.</td></tr><tr><td class="mia-table-text-bold">Intensity mode</td><td>Controls the source for the intensity image against which the watershed transform will be computed.  Irrespective of mode, the image (raw image or object distance map) will act as a surface that the starting points will evolve up until adjacent regions come into contact (at which point creating a dividing line between the two):<br><ul><li>"Distance" A distance map will be created from the input binary image and used as the surface against which the watershed regions will evolve.</li><li>"Input image intensity" The watershed regions will evolve against an image from the workspace.  This image will be unaffected by this process.  The image should have lower intensity coincident with the markers, rising to higher intensity along the boundaries between regions. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="mia-table-text-bold">Intensity image</td><td>If "Intensity mode" is set to "Input image intensity", this is the image from the workspace against which the watershed regions will evolve.  The image should have lower intensity coincident with the markers, rising to higher intensity along the boundaries between regions.</td></tr><tr><td class="mia-table-text-bold">Dynamic</td><td>If "Use markers" is not selected, the initial region markers will be created by generating a distance map for the input binary image and calculating the extended minima.  This parameter specifies the maximum permitted pixel intensity difference for a single marker.  Local intensity differences greater than this will result in creation of more markers.  The smaller the dynamic value is, the more the watershed transform will split the image.</td></tr><tr><td class="mia-table-text-bold">Connectivity</td><td>Controls which adjacent pixels are considered:<br><ul><li>"6" Only pixels immediately next to the active pixel are considered.

Since the watershed transform is applied on a single 3D stack at a time, multithreading only works for images with multiple channels or timepoints (other stacks will still work, but won't see a speed improvement).
