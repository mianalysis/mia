<h1>Add text</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Adds an overlay to the specified input image showing a fixed text label.  Slice and frame indices can be dynamically inserted into the text using keywords.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Colour mode</b> (default = "Single colour") Method for assigning colour of each object:<br><ul><li>"Child count" Colour is determined by the number of children each object has.  Colour range runs across the first half of the visible spectrum (i.e. red to cyan) and is maximised, so the object with the fewest children is shown in red and the object with the most, in cyan.  Objects without any children are always shown in red.  Child objects used for counting are selected with the "Child objects for colour" parameter.</li><li>"ID" Colour is quasi-randomly selected based on the ID number of the object.  The colour used for a specific ID number will always be the same and is calculated using the equation <i>hue = (ID * 1048576 % 255) / 255</i>.</li><li>"Measurement value" Colour is determined by a measurement value.  Colour range runs across the first half of the visible spectrum (i.e. red to cyan) and is maximised, so the object with the smallest measurement is shown in red and the object with the largest, in cyan.  Objects missing the relevant measurement  are always shown in red.  The measurement value is selected with the "Measurement for colour" parameter.</li><li>"Parent ID" Colour is quasi-randomly selected based on the ID number of a parent of this object.  The colour used for a specific ID number will always be the same and is calculated using the equation <i>hue = (ID * 1048576 % 255) / 255</i>.  The parent object is selected with the "Parent object for colour" parameter.</li><li>"Parent measurement value" Colour is determined by a measurement value of a parent of this object.  Colour range runs across the first half of the visible spectrum (i.e. red to cyan) and is maximised, so the object with the smallest measurement is shown in red and the object with the largest, in cyan.  Objects either missing the relevant measurement or without the relevant parent are always shown in red.  The parent object is selected with the "Parent object for colour" parameter and the measurement value is selected with the "Measurement for colour" parameter.</li><li>"Partner count"  Colour is determined by the number of partners each object has.  Colour range runs across the first half of the visible spectrum (i.e. red to cyan) and is maximised, so the object with the fewest partners is shown in red and the object with the most, in cyan.  Objects without any partners are always shown in red.  Partner objects used for counting are selected with the "Partner objects for colour" parameter.</li><li>"Random colour" Colour is randomly selected for each object.  Unlike the "ID" option, the colours generated here will be different for each evaluation of the module.</li><li>"Single colour" (default option) Colour is fixed to one of a predetermined list of colours.  All objects  will be assigned the same overlay colour.  The colour is chosen using the "Single colour" parameter.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Single colour</b> (default = "White") Colour for all object overlays to be rendered using.  This parameter is used if "Colour mode" is set to "Single colour".  Choices are: White, Black, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Violet, Magenta.</li><br><li><b>Child objects for colour</b> (default = "") Object collection used to determine the colour based on number of children per object when "Colour mode" is set to "Child count".  These objects will be children of the input objects.</li><br><li><b>Measurement for colour</b> (default = "") Measurement used to determine the colour when "Colour mode" is set to either "Measurement value" or "Parent measurement value".</li><br><li><b>Parent object for colour</b> (default = "") Object collection used to determine the colour based on either the ID or measurement value  of a parent object when "Colour mode" is set to either  "Parent ID" or "Parent measurement value".  These objects will be parents of the input objects.</li><br><li><b>Partner objects for colour</b> (default = "") Object collection used to determine the colour based on number of partners per object when "Colour mode" is set to "Partner count".  These objects will be partners of the input objects.</li><br><li><b>Opacity (%)</b> (default = "100.0") Opacity of the overlay to be rendered.  This is a value between 0 (totally transparent) and 100 (totally opaque).</li><br><li><b>Input image</b> (default = "") Image onto which overlay will be rendered.  Input image will only be updated if "Apply to input image" is enabled, otherwise the image containing the overlay will be stored as a new image with name specified by "Output image".</li><br><li><b>Apply to input image</b> (default = "false") Image onto which overlay will be rendered.  Input image will only be updated if "Apply to input image" is enabled, otherwise the image containing the overlay will be stored as a new image with name specified by "Output image".</li><br><li><b>Add output image to workspace</b> (default = "false") If the modifications (overlay) aren't being applied directly to the input image, this control will determine if a separate image containing the overlay should be saved to the workspace.</li><br><li><b>Output image</b> (default = "") The name of the new image to be saved to the workspace (if not applying the changes directly to the input image).</li><br><li><b>Text</b> (default = "") Fixed text to be displayed</li><br><li><b>X-position</b> (default = "0") Horizontal location of the text to be displayed.  Specified in pixel units relative to the left of the image (x=0).</li><br><li><b>Y-position</b> (default = "0") Vertical location of the text to be displayed.  Specified in pixel units relative to the top of the image (y=0).</li><br><li><b>Z-range</b> (default = "1-end") Z-slices on which to display the text.  This is specified as a comma-separated list of slice indices.  The keyword "end" is used to denote the final slice in the stack and will be interpreted automatically.  Accepted formats are "[VALUE]" for a single index, "[RANGE START]-[RANGE END]" for a complete range of indices and "[RANGE START]-[RANGE-END]-[INTERVAL]" for indices evenly spaced at the specified interval.</li><br><li><b>Frame-range</b> (default = "1-end") Frames on which to display the text.  This is specified as a comma-separated list of frame indices.  The keyword "end" is used to denote the final frame in the stack and will be interpreted automatically.  Accepted formats are "[VALUE]" for a single index, "[RANGE START]-[RANGE END]" for a complete range of indices and "[RANGE START]-[RANGE-END]-[INTERVAL]" for indices evenly spaced at the specified interval.</li><br><li><b>Label size</b> (default = "8") Font size of the text label.</li><br><li><b>Label colour</b> (default = "Black") Colour of the text label.  Choices are: White, Black, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Violet, Magenta.</li><br></ul>
