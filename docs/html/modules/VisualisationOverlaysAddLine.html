<h1>Add line</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Draws an overlay line between two specified points.<br><br>Note: This currently only works in 2D.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Colour mode</b> (default = "Single colour") Method for determining colour of each object's corresponding overlay:<br><ul><li>"Child count" Overlay colour is determined by the number of children each object has.  Colour range runs across the first half of the visible spectrum (i.e. red to cyan) and is maximised, so the object with the fewest children is shown in red and the object with the most, in cyan.  Objects without any children are always shown in red.  Child objects used for counting are selected with the "Child objects for colour" parameter.</li><li>"ID" Overlay colour is quasi-randomly selected based on the ID number of the object.  The colour used for a specific ID number will always be the same and is calculated using the equation <i>hue = (ID * 1048576 % 255) / 255</i>.</li><li>"Measurement value" Overlay colour is determined by a measurement value.  Colour range runs across the first half of the visible spectrum (i.e. red to cyan) and is maximised, so the object with the smallest measurement is shown in red and the object with the largest, in cyan.  Objects missing the relevant measurement  are always shown in red.  The measurement value is selected with the "Measurement for colour" parameter.</li><li>"Parent ID" Overlay colour is quasi-randomly selected based on the ID number of a parent of this object.  The colour used for a specific ID number will always be the same and is calculated using the equation <i>hue = (ID * 1048576 % 255) / 255</i>.  The parent object is selected with the "Parent object for colour" parameter.</li><li>"Parent measurement value" Overlay colour is determined by a measurement value of a parent of this object.  Colour range runs across the first half of the visible spectrum (i.e. red to cyan) and is maximised, so the object with the smallest measurement is shown in red and the object with the largest, in cyan.  Objects either missing the relevant measurement or without the relevant parent are always shown in red.  The parent object is selected with the "Parent object for colour" parameter and the measurement value is selected with the "Measurement for colour" parameter.</li><li>"Partner count"  Overlay colour is determined by the number of partners each object has.  Colour range runs across the first half of the visible spectrum (i.e. red to cyan) and is maximised, so the object with the fewest partners is shown in red and the object with the most, in cyan.  Objects without any partners are always shown in red.  Partner objects used for counting are selected with the "Partner objects for colour" parameter.</li><li>"Random colour" Overlay colour is randomly selected for each object.  Unlike the "ID" option, the colours generated here will be different for each evaluation of the module.</li><li>"Single colour" (default option) Overlay colour is fixed to one of a predetermined list of colours.  All objects  will be assigned the same overlay colour.  The colour is chosen using the "Single colour" parameter.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Single colour</b> (default = "White") Colour for all object overlays to be rendered using.  This parameter is used if "Colour mode" is set to "Single colour".  Options are: White, Black, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Violet, Magenta.</li><br><li><b>Child objects for colour</b> (default = "") Object collection used to determine the colour of the overlay based on number of children per object when "Colour mode" is set to "Child count".  These objects will be children of the input objects.</li><br><li><b>Measurement for colour</b> (default = "") Measurement used to determine the colour of the overlay when "Colour mode" is set to either "Measurement value" or "Parent measurement value".</li><br><li><b>Parent object for colour</b> (default = "") Object collection used to determine the colour of the overlay based on either the ID or measurement value  of a parent object when "Colour mode" is set to either  "Parent ID" or "Parent measurement value".  These objects will be parents of the input objects.</li><br><li><b>Partner objects for colour</b> (default = "") Object collection used to determine the colour of the overlay based on number of partners per object when "Colour mode" is set to "Partner count".  These objects will be partners of the input objects.</li><br><li><b>Opacity (%)</b> (default = "100.0") Opacity of the overlay to be rendered.  This is a value between 0 (totally transparent) and 100 (totally opaque).</li><br><li><b>Input image</b> (default = "") Image onto which overlay will be rendered.  Input image will only be updated if "Apply to input image" is enabled, otherwise the image containing the overlay will be stored as a new image with name specified by "Output image".</li><br><li><b>Input objects</b> (default = "") Objects to represent as overlays.</li><br><li><b>Apply to input image</b> (default = "false") Determines if the modifications made to the input image (added overlay elements) will be applied to that image or directed to a new image.  When selected, the input image will be updated.</li><br><li><b>Add output image to workspace</b> (default = "false") If the modifications (overlay) aren't being applied directly to the input image, this control will determine if a separate image containing the overlay should be saved to the workspace.</li><br><li><b>Output image</b> (default = "") The name of the new image to be saved to the workspace (if not applying the changes directly to the input image).</li><br><li><b>Reference mode 1</b> (default = "Object centroid") Controls for the location of the first end of the line to be drawn:<br><br>- "Object centroid" This end of the line is coincident with the centre of the input object.<br><br>- "Image measurement" This end of the line is coincident with a pair of XY measurements taken from an image.  The image to be used is selected with the "Reference image 1" parameter and the measurements by the "X-pos. image meas. 1 (px)" and "Y-pos. image meas. 1 (px)" parameters.<br><br>- "Object measurement" This end of the line is coincident with a pair of XY measurements taken from the current object.  The measurements are selected with the "X-pos. object meas. 1 (px)" and "Y-pos. object meas. 1 (px)" parameters.<br></li><br><li><b>Reference image 1</b> (default = "") Image providing the XY coordinate measurements to be used as the location of the first end of the line.</li><br><li><b>X-pos. image meas. 1 (px)</b> (default = "") Measurement used as X-coordinate for the first end of the line.  This measurement will be taken from the image specified by "Reference image 1" when "Reference mode 1" is set to "Image measurement".  The coordinate value is specified in pixel units.</li><br><li><b>Y-pos. image meas. 1 (px)</b> (default = "") Measurement used as Y-coordinate for the first end of the line.  This measurement will be taken from the image specified by "Reference image 1" when "Reference mode 1" is set to "Image measurement".  The coordinate value is specified in pixel units.</li><br><li><b>X-pos. object meas. 1 (px)</b> (default = "") Measurement used as X-coordinate for the first end of the line.  This measurement will be taken from the current object.  The coordinate value is specified in pixel units.</li><br><li><b>Y-pos. object meas. 1 (px)</b> (default = "") Measurement used as Y-coordinate for the first end of the line.  This measurement will be taken from the current object.  The coordinate value is specified in pixel units.</li><br><li><b>Reference mode 2</b> (default = "Object centroid") Controls for the location of the second end of the line to be drawn:<br><br>- "Object centroid" This end of the line is coincident with the centre of the input object.<br><br>- "Image measurement" This end of the line is coincident with a pair of XY measurements taken from an image.  The image to be used is selected with the "Reference image 2" parameter and the measurements by the "X-pos. image meas. 2 (px)" and "Y-pos. image meas. 2 (px)" parameters.<br><br>- "Object measurement" This end of the line is coincident with a pair of XY measurements taken from the current object.  The measurements are selected with the "X-pos. object meas. 2 (px)" and "Y-pos. object meas. 2 (px)" parameters.<br></li><br><li><b>Reference image 2</b> (default = "") Image providing the XY coordinate measurements to be used as the location of the second end of the line.</li><br><li><b>X-pos. image meas. 2 (px)</b> (default = "") Measurement used as X-coordinate for the second end of the line.
