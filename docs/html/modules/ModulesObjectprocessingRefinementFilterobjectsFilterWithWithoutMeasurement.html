<h1>With / without measurement</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Filter an object collection based on the presence of a specific measurement for each object.  Objects which do/don't have the relevant measurement can be removed from the input collection, moved to another collection (and removed from the input collection) or simply counted (but retained in the input collection).  The number of objects failing the filter can be stored as a metadata value.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input objects</b> (default = "") Objects to be filtered.</li><br><li><b>Filter mode</b> (default = "Remove filtered objects") Controls what happens to objects which don't pass the filter:<br><ul><li>"Do nothing" Retains all input objects, irrespective of whether they passed or failed the filter.  This is useful when also storing the filter results as metadata values (i.e. just counting the number of objects which pass the filter).</li><li>"Move filtered objects to new class" Objects failing the filter are moved to a new object class.  The name of the class is determined by the "Output (filtered) objects" parameter.  All existing measurements and relationships are carried forward into the new object collection.</li><li>"Remove filtered objects" (default) Removes objects failing the filter.  Once removed, these objects are unavailable for further use by modules and won't be included in exported results.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Output (filtered) objects</b> (default = "") New object collection containing input objects which did not pass the filter.  These objects are only stored if "Filter mode" is set to "Move filtered objects to new class".</li><br><li><b>Method for filtering</b> (default = "Remove objects without measurement") Controls whether objects are removed when a specific measurement is present or not:<br><br>- "Remove objects without measurement" Objects without the measurement specified by "Measurement to filter on" are removed, counted or moved (depending on the "Filter mode" parameter).<br><br>- "Remove objects with measurement" Objects with the measurement specified by "Measurement to filter on" are removed, counted or moved (depending on the "Filter mode" parameter).<br></li><br><li><b>Measurement to filter on</b> (default = "") Measurement to filter by.  The presence or absence of this measurement will determine which of the input objects are counted, removed or moved (depending on the "Filter mode" parameter).</li><br><li><b>Store filter results</b> (default = "false") When selected, the number of removed (or moved) objects is counted and stored as a metadata item (name in the format "FILTER // NUM_[inputObjectsName] WITHOUT [measurementName] MEASUREMENT").</li><br></ul>
